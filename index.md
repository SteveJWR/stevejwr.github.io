I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Statistics at the University of Washington.  I have been fortunate to be advised by Professors [Yen-Chi Chen](http://faculty.washington.edu/yenchic/), and [Tyler McCormick](https://thmccormick.github.io/) as well as collaborate with [Kwun Chuen Gary Chan](http://faculty.washington.edu/kcgchan/).  Previously I recieved my MS in Statistics at the University of Toronto and BS in Mathematical Physics at Queen's University. 

## Research 

My research is motivated by the applications and theory of latent variable models, particularly with applications to statistical network analysis and neurodegenerative disease research.  My theoretical interest lie in understanding the limits of deconvolution and identification of geometric properties of latent variable models.  Recently, I have also been interested in causality under interference.

### Nonparametric Data Harmonization 
In neuropsychological research collections of tests are used in order to measure particular cognitive traits.  Over the versions of tests may be changed, leading to challenges in longitudinal analysis over prolonged time periods.  We present a model for outcome imputation we refer to as DNoise which posits a nonparametric latent distribution and converts the scores via matching the quantiles of the corresponding measurements.  This allows a user to impute the missing outcomes on the desired scale, and allows for longer term study of cognitive decline.

### Rate Optimal Deconvolution of the Semiparametric Rasch Model and High Dimensional Goodness-of-Fit Tests
We consider the semiparametric Rasch model, the canonical nonparametric item response theory model. This involves a random variable 


$$ \theta_i \sim G $$

$$ P(Y_{ij} = 1|\theta_i, \beta_j) = (1 + \exp(-(\theta_i - \beta_j)))^{-1} $$

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
