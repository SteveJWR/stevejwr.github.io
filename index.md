I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Statistics at the University of Washington.  I have been fortunate to be advised by Professors [Yen-Chi Chen](http://faculty.washington.edu/yenchic/), and [Tyler McCormick](https://thmccormick.github.io/) as well as collaborate with [Kwun Chuen Gary Chan](http://faculty.washington.edu/kcgchan/).  Previously I recieved my MS in Statistics at the University of Toronto and BS in Mathematical Physics at Queen's University. 

## Research 

My research is motivated by the applications and theory of latent variable models, particularly with applications to statistical network analysis and neurodegenerative disease research.  My theoretical interest lie in understanding the limits of deconvolution and identification of geometric properties of latent variable models.  Recently, I have also been interested in causality under interference.

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
